Lead Flashing (3 in. Vents) In many areas of the United States plumbing vents are sealed with lead. Unfortunately, squirrels like to gnaw on the lead and tear it open, potentially causing roof leaks.

A repair that requires shingle removal rarely looks good potentially exposes damage and is expensive. Critter Quitter offers a cost effective and attractive solution to this problem. A home owner can repair their damaged plumbing vents without having to remove shingles or call a professional. Simply cut the unit to match your roof pitch, slide the unit onto the damaged vent and secure with 4 stainless steel screws (provided).
